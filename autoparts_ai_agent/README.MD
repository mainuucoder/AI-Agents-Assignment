# AI Agents Assignment: AutoParts Inc. Simulation

## 🏭 Project Overview
Simulation of AI Quality Control Agents for automotive manufacturing using n8n workflow automation.

## 🤖 AI Agents Implemented
1. **Quality Control Agent** - Defect detection simulation
2. **Routing Agent** - Intelligent defect/pass routing  
3. **Alerting Agent** - Automated email notifications
4. **Logging Agent** - Real-time data recording

## 🔗 Simulation Files
- `workflows/autoparts_ai_agent.json` - Complete n8n workflow
- `screenshots/` - Execution proofs

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Import JSON file into n8n.io
2. Connect Google Sheets credentials
3. Activate workflow
4. Monitor execution in n8n dashboard
